<h2>About the Evangelism Ministry</h2>
<p>Evangelism is being, doing and telling the gospel of the kingdom of God, in order that by the power of the Holy Spirit, persons and structures may be converted to the lordship of Jesus Christ. Evangelism is sharing the good news that the rule of God has come, is coming, and will come, through Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2>Evangelism is Three-Dimensional.</h2>
<p>It is being, doing and telling the gospel. Evangelism is being the salt of the earth, the light of the world, and the aroma of Christ. This is the "being" dimension. Evangelism is fishing for persons, bearing fruit that abides forever, and engaging in the ministry of reconciliation. This is the dimension of "doing". Evangelism is the proclamation of the gospel, bearing witness of Jesus Christ, and advertising the wonderful deeds of God in Christ. This is the "telling " dimension.</p>
<p>We evangelize through being the good news, doing the good news, and telling the good news. Making disciples is a task which always includes these three aspects: life, love, and lips.</p>
<p>Effective evangelism has to be incarnated in the servant's lifestyle. It is about doing good in the name of Jesus Christ. And it has to proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God. The basic content of evangelism is the good news about God's government. Evangelism is God's good news for man's bad news.</p>
<p>Evangelism transforms relationships and attitudes and is dependent upon the power of the Holy Spirit. Evangelism is spiritual work by spiritual persons who have spiritual power! The Holy Spirit opens doors for evangelization as he opened the prison doors for the apostles in Acts 5:19.</p>
<p>The Evangelist is a change agent, dealing first and foremost with that change called "repentance". The most profound change any person can ever experience is Biblical repentance. Conversion is the fundamental change in a person (see Matthew 12:33). It is a cleansing from the inside out (see Matthew 23:26).</p>
<p>The Evangelist's agenda is not hidden. We are out to change the minds and hearts of persons. We also seek to change the attitudes and actions of individuals.</p>
<h2>Evangelism seeks to make new persons.</h2>
<p>It has to do with being a new person, a new creation, and begins with new birth or being born again. The Bible says:</p>
<p>"In reply Jesus declared, "I tell you the truth, unless a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." John 3:3</p>
<p>Real evangelism is reaching out in love to the people who are in our world of influence and seeks to convert the nuclear family, the extended family, the tribe, the caste, the clan and all the ethnic groups of humanity.</p>
<p>"This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth." 1 Tim. 2:3-4</p>
<h2>Evangelism should be a passion rather than promotion.</h2>
<p>When evangelism is a passion, it is concerned primarily with the salvation of a person. When it is promotion, its concern is statistics. When evangelism is a passion it is used to advance the Kingdom of God. When it is promotion, it is used to enlarge an institution. When evangelism is a passion, joy and exhilaration are present in its performance. When it is promotion, pressure and strain exist in its application. When evangelism is a passion, it is an exercise of the loving heart. When it is promotion, it resorts to ecclesiastical gimmickry to achieve religious success.</p>
<p>Christians are witnesses in different ways: by word of mouth (to individuals, small groups, or large crowds); by written words and visuals; by good works of love; by a Christ-centered home; by a transformed life; and by an almost speechless excitement about Jesus.</p>
<p>Winning souls for Christ is the responsibility of every organization, every ministry, and every individual within the church.</p>

<!-- Lifestyle Evangelism Page -->
<h1>Lifestyle Evagelism</h1>
<p>Another means which every Christian has at his or her disposal for witnessing is Lifestyle Evangelism.</p>
<h2>Lifestyle Evangelism</h2>
<p>Lifestyle Evangelism is a life-sharing, life-giving evangelism which includes a verbal sharing of what Christ means in a person's life. Lifestyle Evangelism is an expression of one's faith that begins with the new birth experience and ends with the last breath.</p>
<p>It is a commitment. A person has to make a total commitment to Christ. Once they do, they commit themselves to everything Christ is and stands for. They begin to act with sensitivity and understanding.</p>
<p>Every Christian is a witness, be it a winning and willing witness, or a reluctant witness.</p>
<h3>Every Member Evangelism</h3>
<p>Lifestyle Evangelism is every Christian being a witness to Jesus Christ.</p>
<h3>Every Day Evangelism</h3>
<p>Lifestyle Evangelism is the rank-and-file Christians witnessing every day in their natural, normal daily contacts and relationships.</p>
<h3>Everywhere Evangelism</h3>
<p>Lifestyle Evangelism has no special place where it is practiced. It can be done anywhere, anytime, by any Christian. Jesus was doing lifestyle evangelism when He introduced the woman of Samaria to living water beside Jacob's well (see John 4).</p>
<h3>Demonstration Evangelism</h3>
<p>Lifestyle Evangelism is to live in a way that what we are speaks as loudly as what we say.</p>
<p>Lifestyle Evangelism is "show and tell" evangelism. It is witnessing in such a way that one's own lifestyle endeavors to be a living example of God's intention for humanity.</p>
<h3>Body Evangelism</h3>
<p>Lifestyle Evangelism is "Body Evangelism". It is concerned with building up the body of Christ, the church.</p>
<p>Lifestyle Evangelism seeks to relate the convert to the church. It seeks to help persons find their place in that mystical body of Christ and in a local body of believers.</p>
<p>Lifestyle Evangelism is body evangelism in the sense that it involves every member of the body of Christ.</p>
<p>Lifestyle Evangelism sees the church as a body gifted by the Holy Trinity with the necessary spiritual gifts to build up the body of Christ in the world.</p>
<p>Lifestyle Evangelism is not only body evangelism in the sense of bodybuilding and spiritual gifts, but also in that we also offer our very own bodies as a living sacrifice to Christ. Lifestyle evangelism begins with the death to self and the offering of our own bodies to Christ in His service.</p>
<p>[scripture quote] The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise. Proverbs 11:30</p>
