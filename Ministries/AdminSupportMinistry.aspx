    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        To render excellent service through an operational structure that values and supports the gifts and 
        abilities of God’s people; providing administrative leadership that enables staff and ministries to operate 
        together in pursuit of the vision of Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church.
    </p>
    <p>
        Primary responsibility is to provide oversight for the day-to-day operations of the church.  Pastor Patterson 
        serve with a team of men and women in providing administrative leadership to the program staff and ministry leaders.  
        The Administrative Leadership Team includes three groups of people:  Senior Pastor and Staff, the Diaconate, and the 
        Trustees.
    </p>
    <h3>The Senior Pastor</h3> 
    <p>
        The Senior Pastor provides general watchcare and oversight.  He continually evaluate the ministry of the 
        church and review major ministry decisions and strategic initiatives.  He has the ultimate responsibility 
        and authority to use his wisdom, discernment and shepherding gift to ensure the church remains on a true 
        course biblically, that its members are being appropriately shepherded, that the body is being fed through 
        insightful and accurate biblical teaching, and that the life of the church is being well managed with the 
        assistance of other competent and godly leaders.  The senior pastor, in addition to his shepherding role, 
        is primarily responsible to be a teacher of the Word of God and to provide strategic leadership and vision 
        to the body.  
    </p>	
    <h3>The Diaconate Ministry</h3>
    <p>
        The Diaconate is a group of men and women who have been chosen by Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church’s 
        congregation and serve the visible (social, emotional, physical and financial) and spiritual needs of 
        the Church and its community. The Diaconate’s Mission is to care for and service those who are in need, 
        both within and beyond the community of faith, and to equip others to minister with the Deacons and 
        Deaconesses.  The Diaconate work with individuals and families in distressing or challenging situations, 
        are available for prayer, questions or counsel after each service.  The Diaconate is to care about the 
        spiritual and physical well-being of members, regularly praying for the sick.  They work in partnership 
        with the Pastor to guard the body against harmful influences, confronting those who are contradicting 
        biblical truth or who are continuing in patterns of sinful behavior.  In doing so, they are to keep closing 
        potential entrances for Satan, so that the truth of Christ will remain credible to both the congregation and 
        the community. 
        <span style="color: Blue; font-size: 8pt; font-style: italic;">(Biblical Qualifications for Diaconate Members are summarized in 1 Timothy 3:2-7 and Titus 1:6-9)</span>
    </p>
    <h3>The Trustee Ministry</h3>
    <p>
        The Trustees are members of the church empowered by the congregation to oversee the legal and 
        financial  aspects of the ministry and matters pertaining to the building and facilities.  Each member 
        has been entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing legal and financial matters and to provide for 
        the care and maintenance of all properties owned by the church.
    </p>
    <h3>The Administrative Leadership Team</h3>
    <p>
        The Administrative Leadership Team oversees day-to-day operations of the church and provides the vision 
        for future direction of the church.    At present, the members of the management team are key staff members 
        [paid and volunteer] holding these positions:
    </p>
    <ul class="indentedNakedList">
        <li>Senior Pastor</li>
        <li>Executive Minister</li>
        <li>Executive Director of Church Operations/ Director of Discipleship Ministries</li>
        <li>Director of Worship Ministries/Director for NexGen Ministries</li>
        <li>Finance Officer</li>
        <li>Stewardship Development Representative</li>
        <li>Director of Evangelism & Missions</li>
        <li>Diaconate Chair/Representative</li>
        <li>Trustee Chair/Representative</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Through the Management Team, each ministry or department within the church has the opportunity 
        to have their views expressed and issues addressed.  The Senior Pastor’s leadership in all three 
        groups, Diaconate, Trustees, and Management, provides communication, openness, and accountability 
        across the three groups.
    </p>
    <h3>Church Support Ministries</h3>
    <h4>Accounting and Finance</h4>
    <p>
        The Office of Accounting and Finance supports the Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church by recording, 
        processing, and maintaining an accurate record of all income received and all monies expended. 
        This office develops and implements accounting practices in accordance with Generally Accepted 
        Accounting Principles. All financial transactions for the church are centralized under the Accounting 
        and Finance Office, which is comprised of the following positions:

    <h4>Stewardship Education</h4>
    <p>
        Although money is an integral part of our lives, many of us lack a proper understanding of it. 
        We may believe the only money problem we face is not having enough. However, many times we have 
        an adequate amount but need to use it more wisely. Stewardship education is learning what God 
        has to say about this area of our lives, then recognizing His authority over our lives and possessions.
    </p> 
    <p>
        God gives us freedom to determine how we want to spend money, but the Bible is very clear about what 
        God expects from us. The fact that God put all things, including money, at our disposal means we have 
        an obligation to use them according to His plan. To do that, we must seek His wisdom and understanding 
        through the study of His Word and by taking advantage of the programs developed for you to become money 
        wise and to achieve financial freedom.

        to minister to members and visitors through hospitality and serving.
    </p>
    <p>

        skills, along with the gift of serving, to ensure the success of all ministry events. Serving in 
        this ministry requires a deep commitment and a heart to serve others. The Word reminds us in I 
        Peter 4:8-10 that “above all, love each other deeply, because love covers a multitude of sins. 
        Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling. Each one should use whatever gift he/she has 
        received to serve others, faithfully administering God’s grace in various forms.”
