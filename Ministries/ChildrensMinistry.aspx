    <!-- Sub-page: Discipline & Behavior -->
    <h1>Discipline</h1>
    <p>The Children's Ministry promotes learning through a variety of experiences. During these learning experiences, a child may be required to interact with other children. During this interaction, situations may arise that invite unwelcome and unwanted behavior.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to provide an atmosphere that is healthy and safe for every child. We want to develop the whole child, therefore it is necessary to establish and enforce discipline. Our discipline policy and consequences are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep all body parts to oneself.</li>
        <li>Treat everyone with kindness.</li>
        <li>Follow instructions give by adult team members.</li>
        <li>Return pens, pencils & toys to their proper place.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Consequences</h1>
    <p>If a child has difficulty following those rules, the following consequences will be used to correct the behavior:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Step #1</dt><dd>Child will receive a verbal warning.</dd>
        <dt>Step #2</dt><dd>Time out (5 minutes).</dd>
        <dt>Step #3</dt><dd>Removal from area, parent notification.</dd>
        <dt>Step #4</dt><dd>Conference with parent and possible suspension.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>These steps will only be taken in extreme situations. If you have a concern, please notify a member of the Children's Ministry staff.</p>
    <h1>Methods to Promote Acceptable Bahavior</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Consequences that give the children responsibility for their actions are enforced.</li>
        <li>Well-organized classroom routines are established.</li>
        <li>Smooth transitions occur between the various activities.</li>
        <li>Children are praised for being good.</li>
        <li>Consistent behavior is promoted by the team members.</li>
        <li>Children are prepared for schedule changes.</li>
        <li>Alternative activities are planned.</li>
        <li>Positive descriptive verbal attention will be given.</li>
    </ul>
