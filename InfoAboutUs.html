        <p>It is the desire of our staff and our congregation, that all who visit here will see this site as 
         a spiritual resource to strengthen and aid you in those needs which grip the contemporary family. 
         We especially want this to be a library support for your biblical needs, Christian growth, and daily 
         inquiry.</p>
        
        <p>Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church is a church where everybody is somebody and nobody is nobody; 
        where love is personified, humanity is amplified and God is glorified, worshipped and served. We are 
        a Gospel-driven church with a multicultural congregation who are determined to preach, teach and live 
        the redeeming love of God to a lost, but changing world.</p>
        
        <p>We have a commitment to inclusiveness. All who desire to come and worship with us are welcome and are 
        invited to come and join our church family.</p>
        
        <p>You may simply want to attend our services; welcome! You may only want to visit; welcome! You may want to join 
         by association or watchcare; welcome! Or, you may desire full membership in our church family; whosoever will, 
         come and welcome!</p>
