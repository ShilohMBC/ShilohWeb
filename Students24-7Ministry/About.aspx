    <h2>About the Student 24/7 Ministry</h2>
    <p><i>Equipping our youths to be devoted followers of Christ</i></p>
    <div class="quote">
        <blockquote>"Since my youth, O God, you have taught me, and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds."</blockquote>
        <cite>Psalm 71:17</cite>
    </div>
    <p>Being a follower of Christ is what God desires for our young students. That they may be fully equipped to teach, preach, and live the redeeming love of God to a lost, but changing world. Student Ministry in Shiloh is the area in Christian Education that continues to transform and equip our young students through Prayer and Bible Study Groups that encourage our students to Reach out to God, to Connect with God, to Grow in God, to Discover God, and to Honor God.</p>
    <p>To join Shiloh Student Ministries please call 276-6673.</p>
    <p>Beginning in January, we will start the year off with a MLK Celebration. We don't want the next generation to ever forget the significance of Dr. King's message of peace and equality or the sacrifice he made in securing the freedoms we now enjoy.</p>
    <p>February is the time we set aside to focus on sexual purity. On the youth level, we will host a seminar called "True Love Waits". The purpose is to teach our youth about sexual purity from God's perspective, abstinence. February is also Black History Month, which means we will remember the pioneers in our culture throughout the month.</p>
    <p>March is when we will place greater emphasis on the overall church theme for 2005, which is "Christ-Centered". We'll use our Youth Spring Break discipleship retreat as the platform to emphasize this theme. We want our youth to know that Christ must be the center of their lives.</p>
    <p>April is our Mission Outreach Month. We will participate in a national fast sponsored by World Vision called "30 Hour Famine". Our youth will make a physical sacrifice and raise money to help feed starving children in 3rd world countries. This event will be held on April 29-30 beginning at 6:00 PM. Check our new Upcoming Events page for more information.</p>
    <h3>Game Night and Movie Night 2nd and 4th Fridays at 6:00 PM!</h3>
    <p>In addition to these major events, we'll also continue our biweekly youth fellowships, also known as Game Night and Movie Night. These fellowships are designed to give our youth an opportunity to engage each other in an environment that they can call their own. We meet every 2nd and 4th Friday at 6:00 PM.</p>
    <h2>Something New</h2>
    <p>Ministry service requires time and resources. One of the greatest resources we lack is people; parents and team members. We could accomplish the mission with greater success if we had more involvement from parents. Our goal is to partner with parents and work together to ensure our youth are receiving a solid spiritual foundation.</p>
    <p>I encourage you to take an interest in what our youth are learning. Make an investment in their spiritual future. They need to know that their mom's and dad's are concerned about their spiritual development. We reemphasize what they are taught at home... so it becomes a team effort. For this cause, starting this month, we will be having quarterly parent conferences. These conferences will bring ministry team members and parents together for the purpose of dialoging about what we can do to make this ministry the best it can be.</p>
