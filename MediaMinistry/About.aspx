    <p>        
        The purpose of the Media Ministry here at Shiloh is to support and help lead worship at all of our services as
        well as to equip other ministries of the church to use digital and electronic media as a worship 
        and outreach tool. We help fulfill Shiloh's vision of preaching, teaching and living the redeeming love of
        God to a lost but ever changing world through use of technology and media.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do you have a natural gift for computers or sound equipment?  Or maybe you just have a strong desire to learn, 
        along with a passion to serve the body of Christ? If you answered yes to any of these questions, 
        then you are invited to join us! The Shiloh media team is here to train and help you learn what you will need to 
        know and have fun in the process!

        We need people to be responsible for a role listed below at each and every scheduled weekend service and 
        Wednesday night service (when applicable):                  
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 0.75em;">
        <li>
            <b>Sound Engineer</b> - You will control the volume levels for all microphones and instruments used on the stage 
            and through the house sound system.  You will also control the sound for any pre-recorded music or video.
            You will be trained to use the sound board, monitors and all other audio equipment.            
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Computer Worship Leader </b> - You will work on a computer to display and change lyrics, show announcements,
            follow the flow of service, play music and show videos (all through Easy Worship) which will be projected on the various screens 
            located throughout the sanctuary. You will be responsible in helping the pulpit lead the congregation in praise and worship.
            You will be trained to use the computer and the accompanying software to perform these duties.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Music/Video Coordinator</b> - You will be responsible with coming up with <b>approved</b> music or video playlists that
            will be played before each service.  You will work with the team leader and the worship leader to put together
            a playlist that compliments the theme for worship.
        </li>
    </ul>    
    <p>
        We are very flexible so you do not have to be present at every service to be a team member.  You will be assigned a 
        specific day each month (e.g. 1st Sunday, 3rd Wednesday, Last Sunday etc.) to perform your duties for the team.
    </p>
