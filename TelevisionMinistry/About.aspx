        <h3>Shiloh's Camera Crew for Television Ministry</h3>
        <p><i>by Jacqueline Gay, Media Ministry Director</i></p>
        <p>Cameramen and women work anywhere and everywhere in their craft, from the comfort of TV studios, to war zones. Their work covers a variety of dramas, from chasing wildlife in the jungle to filming a church program for television. They record action on film, for TV programs or on videotape. Most camera operators specialize in electronic cameras or film.</p>
        <p>The men of Shiloh's TV Ministry specialize in church programming and filming every Sunday morning. Let me introduce to you the cameramen: Brian Burd, Chad Ponder, Franklin Harris, Louis McBride, Darrion Tipton, Wayne Hardy (Editor) and Deacon James Gay. There are two young adult men who also serve as alternate cameramen, Matthew and Mark Jackson.</p>
        <p>The Television Ministry uses five cameras: a fixed camera located in the ceiling at the front of the church sanctuary main floor; two mobile cameras stationed at the front of the Sanctuary; one large camera stationed in the balcony and a fixed camera positioned at the back of the sanctuary below the balcony. Each camera operator works very closely with the Technical Director who directs them on which shots to take and when their camera is "live". Our cameramen use single lens cameras and controls for framing of the shots. They hear words and phrases like <i>"find your target, focus, you are live, find me another shot… focus, zoom in and… focus, continue to pan, hold steady,</i> or <i>stand by camera 1, 2 or 3</i> and most famously, <i>camera #4 can you go mobile now I really need that shot?</i>" </p>
        <p>Presently we use camera #4 as our mobile unit and it can get pretty heavy on your shoulder during the course of service. Every Sunday morning or during a Sunday evening event that is recorded, you will find our men on camera – filming. Mr. Wayne Hardy is working in conjunction with Mr. David McKenzie-Cole as editor of the programs once they are recorded. Editing can become tedious, but the effort is rewarded as the editors insure the program flow and consistency. Our editor also plans and organizes the program to insure that deadlines are met. An editor must possess a very high standard of written and spoken English, as communication is a large part of this job. The editor needs to be able to work with cameramen when the technical director is unavailable. Our editor and cameramen are often on duty every Sunday, and are dedicated to this ministry and the work that we do.</p>
        <p>Finally, I would like to especially acknowledge a young man who has a wonderful "eye" for good camera shots, especially those which involve outside scenery; he is truly a budding artist - Mr. Chad Ponder. Chad has taken some wonderful still/moving shots that you see featured in the opening and closing of our Sunday morning TV program.</p>
        <p>We say "thank you" to the men of Shiloh who serve in the TV Ministry. On Sundays when you see them working with the cameras, give them a pat on the back or a simple "thanks" because they do a great work each week.</p>
        <p>If you have an interest in working with the Television Ministry as a cameraperson, please contact one of the ministry leaders or the church secretary. Remember, you must have sufficient strength to carry/move heavy cameras. If you're serious about working as a cameraperson, you'd better get down to the gym!</p>
