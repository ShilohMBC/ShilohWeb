    <h2>About the Single Adult Ministry</h2>
    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
    <p>Shiloh Single Adult Ministry provides a safe place where individuals are encouraged to grow stronger in their faith and friendships through prayer, Bible studies, activities and ministry to the church and the community.</p>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>To help our single adults become fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ - a People of Passion!</p>

    <h3>A Place to Belong</h3> 
    <p>Single Adult Ministry is a place to belong and have a rightful place. Shiloh Single Adult Ministry invites single adults to become a part of a dynamic, high energy ministry designed for those between the ages of 25 and 60. S.A.M. is divided into four distinct groups: Divorced or Widowed, Never Married, Single Parents, and Young Adults 25-35.</p>

    <h3>A Place to Connect</h3>
    <p>In this fast-paced world it is often difficult to find time to develop meaningful relationships that last. We all desire friends to "do life" with, people with whom we can hang out and have a good time. We also desire friends who challenge us to sharpen our character. In Single Adult Ministry, you will have numerous opportunities to connect with other like-minded men and women to cultivate these kinds of relationships.</p>

    <h3>A Place to Grow</h3>
    <p>Not only is S.A.M. a place to belong and connect, it is also a place to grow in your spiritual journey, no matter where you currently are. You'll discover more about God's purpose for your life and how much you matter to Him. Our leadership teams are trained to assist you in helping you discover your next steps and then challenge and encourage you to get there.</p>
