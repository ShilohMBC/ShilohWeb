            Sunday, May 25, 1952 marked the beginning of Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church. More than thirty people 
            assembled in the Carpenter's Hall to organize the church. Reverend John N. Deforre, the pastor of 
            Calvary Baptist Church, presided at the organizing meeting. Reverend John L. Holiday was elected 
            Shiloh's first pastor. Mrs. Anne B. Smith was secretary; Governor Chamblis, Willie Hurt,
            Willie Leslie and J.K. Davis were elected the first deacons. Several days later another meeting 
            was held and Thomas A. Lewis, W.O. McGee and Henry Burton were elected to the Board of Trustees. 
            Velma Smith, Ola B. Leslie, Verna Mae Nealy and Amanda Gaines were elected to the Deaconess Board.

            In 1954, Shiloh moved to the basement of a site at 229 West 8th Avenue. Reverend
            B.H. Gibbs served as interim pastor until Reverend N.L. Presley was chosen as pastor.
            Reverend Presley served until 1956. A church structure was built on this site and
            was dedicated in October 1958. During the period of 1956-1958, Reverends Chandler
            and Murdock served as pastor of Shiloh. Reverend Murdock was a pulpit chairman -
            he served until the election of Reverend E.M. Howard in March 1958. Reverend Howard
            was pastor of Shiloh until 1965.

                Reverend Giles Trammel served as interim pastor from December 1965 until January 1966 when 
                Reverend Shedrick Griggs, who had been ordained by Reverend Trammel, was elected to serve as 
                temporary pastor. He was elected pastor in July 1966 and served until his death i in February 
                1970. After Reverend Griggs death, Reverend G.H. Simien and Reverend J.H. Turner and others 
                carried on services for Shiloh. In November of 1970, Reverend Alonzo B. Patterson, Jr. of the 
                Corinthian Baptist Church of Fairbanks, Alaska was elected as pastor.

                Under Pastor Patterson's leadership, Shiloh, who was a member of the Southern Baptist Convention, 
                became affiliated with the National Baptist Convention, USA, and in later years became a member of 
                both the National Baptist and American Baptist Conventions.

            In 1974, Shiloh was forced to relocate as the city of Anchorage developed its downtown area. 
            While waiting to rebuild, Shiloh shared facilities with her sister church, First American Baptist. 
            In the sharing arrangement, Shiloh occupied several areas of the building and shared the sanctuary 
            on Sundays. Sunday school classes were held jointly and First American Baptist held an early 
            worship service while Shiloh held a later service.
            </p>

            <p>
            A groundbreaking service for the new Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church (in its current
            location on 20th Avenue) was held on August 30, 1975. The dream and vision of the
            new church became a reality in August of 1976. On August 8, 1976 (the year Shiloh
            celebrated its twenty-fourth anniversary) members and friends of the new Shiloh
            Missionary Baptist Church gathered at First American Baptist Church and began their
            pilgrimage homeward. The journey was led by the Reverend Holiday (Shiloh's founding
            pastor) and the current pastor, Pastor Alonzo B. Patterson, Jr. 
            </p>

            In the years that followed, Shiloh grew and accomplished many of its dreams and visions
            for ministry. Many new ministries were developed - the Church School, the Bus Ministry
            and various outreach ministries to include a Television Ministry and a Jail Outreach
            Ministry. Shiloh also organized several mission churches throughout Alaska, as well
            as a church in Great Falls, Montana and one in Germany.

            On Shiloh's twenty-ninth anniversary, the mortgage note for the original structure
            was burned and under the theme: "Burning to Build", groundbreaking for the second
            "Educational" wing took place. In 1983, the Education Wing was dedicated.

            In May of 1989, Shiloh broke ground for a third addition to the church, a multipurpose
            facility. The Martin Luther King Jr. Family Life Center was dedicated on May 23,
            1993. This building marked the end of the building program for this century, but
            it marked the beginning of new visions of ministry for Shiloh.

            Utilizing the three facilities, the Worship Center, the Education Center and the
            Family Life Center, Shiloh is moving forward to fulfill its mission and ministry
            to individual families, to the church family, to the extended community, and to
            the world. God has called Shiloh to a new vision! 
            </p>
        
            <p>
            Shiloh is following God's call to mission and ministry. The membership of the church
            now includes 650 families, totaling close to 1100 members and still growing!
