    <p>All people encounter problems from time to time that hinder their spiritual, physical, mental or emotional growth. These problems may result from crisis, unwise choices, improper childhood development, chemical imbalance, challenging situations (transition), or the result of spiritual discipline or testing. Whatever the cause, God calls the church to be an agent for those going through a time of crisis and/or need.</p>
    <p>The Shiloh Pastoral Care Ministries are the umbrella under which specialized care ministries fall. In its simplest form, PCM's goal is to fulfill the church's mission of "Living the redeeming love of God to a lost, but changing world." by caring. The following ministries fall under the umbrella of the Pastoral Care Ministry:</p>
