    <h2>About the Parish Ministry</h2>
    <h3>What is the Parish Ministry Plan?</h3>
    <p>As with all Small Groups within Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church, Parish Ministry works under the overall supervision of the Pastor. The Parish Team meets with the Pastor, Director, Diaconate, and the general council members on a monthly basis to report progress, discuss plans, and receive guidance to strengthen the Parish development.</p>
    <p>Shiloh's membership is divided into fifteen parishes. Each Parish is overseen by a Diaconate Leader with a Minister and a Parish Leader as a part of your "Parish Family Team".</p>
    <img alt="Image of Parish Sections" src="http://www.shiloh2000.net/shiloh/Parish_Ministry/parishpiechart15.jpg" />
    <p>A Parish Team is organized to represent the families within your particular parish, for example, Parish 1 = the "A" families.</p>

    <h3>What impact will the Parish Ministry have on me and my family?</h3>
    <p>Hopefully you will feel more comfortable in being part of a larger family - that of your church. Just as with your own family, you seek to provide the best of life and work hard at it. We too want to work hard at helping to improve the lives of our church family members. By doing this, you should develop strong relationships with other members.</p>
    <p>It is nice in a large congregation such as ours, to be on a first-name-basis, to have friends, to be welcomed or missed, and to be noticed! Most important of all is to fellowship with other Christians in your Parish group!</p>
    <h3></h3>When will I be contacted by my Parish Family Team?</h3>
    <p>Now that each Parish Team is organized, and each family has been assigned to a Parish, your Parish Team will be sending a letter with their phone number and a request for permission to contact you. Then an appointment will be set to visit you.</p>
    <p>Please feel free to call anyone within your Parish Family Team if you do not hear from your Family Sponsor and if you would like to schedule an appointment sooner then the process allows.</p>
    <h3>Each family should support the goals of the Parish Ministry because:</h3>
    <p>In order for any ministry to work, members must be willing to participate. The goals of the Parish Ministry are as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>Improve the quality of life for members of Shiloh.</li>
            <li>Encourage communication between church leaders and church members.</li>
            <li>Enhance fellowship and bring members closer together.</li>
            <li>Cultivate family fellowship.</li>
            <li>Provide direct channels for guidance and problem solving.</li>
            <li>Welcome new members into the church.</li>
            <li>Increase family recognition.</li>
            <li>Share the responsibility of our congregation with our church leaders.</li>
            <li>Support, nurture and care for each of our families in the parishes.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>These are some of the goals we are working towards and we are seeking your support. Together we can accomplish these goals and much more!</p>

    <h3>What is the Shiloh Parish Ministry Family Support System?</h3>
    <p>As Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church ministers to our families, we, the Parish Executive Staff are deeply concerned about about genuine ministry to both our church families and the community, which we are called to serve. Shiloh is organized under the "1-5-4 Ministry" which is: 1) The Great Commission,  2) The five functions: Worship, Discipleship, Fellowship/Membership Care, Ministry and Evangelism, and 3) Assessment, which is numerical growth, spiritual growth, ministry enhancement and mission advancement.</p>
    <p>In order to carry out the Great Commission, we have organized each of the five functions into ministry centers. Each ministry center will oversee a number of other ministries. Each ministry center will oversee a number of other ministries. This information is designed to help you understand the work of the Membership Care Ministry Center. Under the Membership Care Ministry Center there are four sub-ministries to include: the Assimilation Ministry, the Diaconate Ministry, the Family and Community Support Ministry, and the Parish Ministry. Under the Parish Ministry, the church seeks to meet the needs of our families in times of crises such as hospitalizations, subsistence needs, economic devastation, family needs, spiritual isolation, family counseling, financial and vocational planning, death and family recovery. We trust that each family understands that the church does not seek to be a monitor of families, but simply to help in times of crisis. In order to provide this support ministry our church uses this small group ministry concept known as Parish Ministry.</p>
    <h3>Parish Ministry</h3>
    <p>There are 15 parishes in our church. Each parish is overseen by a Diaconate Leader, an assigned Minister and a Parish Leader. Each parish is made up of approximately 25 or more families, which are broken out into Care Groups of five to eight families. Each Diaconate is assigned too oversee a parish and to help shepherd families through major crisis. Each Minister is assigned to help major families in times of sickness, death, communion, family prayer and other needs. Each Parish Leader is assigned to communicate with families.</p>
    <h3>Family and Support Ministry</h3>
    <p>This ministry is designed to help our families with legitimate needs that cannot be met otherwise, to include food subsidy, rent subsidy, financial counseling, family couseling and many other support needs. Each family is encouraged to come into the Family Life Center for help in times of crises.</p>
    <h3>Assimilation Ministry</h3>
    <p>This ministry is designed to help each new family uniting with our church find their place in ministry, to discover their spiritual gifts and to understand our beliefs, our doctrines, our commitment to ministry and their relationship to the church. This process includes coming forward to make a commitment, meeting with the pastor, and attending the required informational classes.</p>
    <p>As a part of our church family, your family is encouraged to participate in the parish ministry process of our church. You should receive a communication from your parish leadership team in the near future. Please receive them warmly and participate fully in your parish efforts.</p>
