                    For more than 100 years, American Baptist home missionaries in Alaska have encouraged life in 
                    Christ through ministries of witness, renewal and justice. Today, mission in Alaska is organized 
                    and energized by members of local American Baptist churches, just as it is in other parts of the 
                    U.S. Currently, 14 American Baptist congregations, located throughout the state, reach out as 
                    ambassadors for Christ to Alaska's multicultural population.
